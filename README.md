# Console Mortgage Calculator
This console application made with Java, helps you calculate your due monthly payments. It asks you the principal amount of loan took from the loaner, then the interest rate in percentage, and the period in years in which you have to complete your payments.

I have created this console application to showcase my skills in object oriented programming using Java. I have used skills such as the use of encapsulation methods to reduce coupling,  creating objects for diffirent classes, using access modifiers, constructors, static members, all that with also the ability to present a clean code.
